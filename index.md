# Research and Projects

### üéπ Generating MIDI Piano Performance with Transformers  
*Summer 2025*  
Lab project under the Computer Vision Chair. Focus: generating MIDI piano performances conditioned on input, using REMI tokenization and Mistral model on MAESTRO dataset. Benchmarking against Museformer, PianoBART, and Moonbeam. Tasks included: working with model architectures, tokenizers, embedding functions, and evaluation metrics.

### üêç Mamba State-space Model  
*Summer 2024*  
Research seminar on **Mamba** (an alternative to Transformers) supervised by Prof. Hector Geffner. Explored application to music data and long sequence processing.

### üéµ Computer-generated Music  
Seminar on neural-network-based music generation (Magenta, Bachbot, LZ compression with OpenMusic). Sparked ongoing interest in the topic.

### üß† Thesis at Institute for Computational and Systems Neuroscience  
*October 2022 ‚Äì May 2023*  
Bachelor‚Äôs thesis on hyperparameter optimization using Optuna. Tested random, evolutionary, and Bayesian methods on neuroscience simulations using the JURECA supercomputer. Tree-structured Parzen Estimator yielded best results.

### üöô Practical at Cyber-Physical Mobility Lab  
*October 2021 ‚Äì February 2022*  
Trajectory planning and collision avoidance for model vehicles. Worked in a Scrum team of six using Git.

# Work Experience
